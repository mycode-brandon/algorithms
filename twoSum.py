# Easy solution using a hashmap (dict). By obtaining the complement to each number in the list, we can make only
# one pass of the list instead of nesting two for loops. If we input the complement into the dict, we can just
# directly check if the next number in the list is in the dict. If so, return those two indices.

def twoSum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    hashmap = dict()
    for index, number in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - number
        if number in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[number], index]
        else:
            hashmap[complement] = index


assert twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) == [0, 1]
